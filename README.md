## Controls  

On the application start, you will be asked to give your and second player's names with token signs you will be using, as well as to choose one of two games - pentago or tic-tac-toe.  

[q], [w], [a], [s] - choose part of the board: top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right  
[1] ... [9] - selection of the field on the part of the board as seen on the numeric keypad (i.e. 1 is the lower left field)  
[z], [x] - rotate selected part of the board: clockwise, counter-clockwise  
[m] - enter options  
[p] - pause  
[u] - undo  
[q] - loading a predefined board  
[n] - change token
[h] - entering the program description  

### Pentago  

First, player selects a part of the board and field (e.g. q5), and then selects a part of the board and direction of the rotation (e.g. az).  

After the game ends, you can look through all the moves in that game.  


### Tic-tac-toe  

The board is 6x6, similarly to pentago, but the rules are the same as classic tic-tac-toe. The only exception is that a player has to have 6 of his token placed in one line, compared to standard three. There is no rotation of the board involved.
